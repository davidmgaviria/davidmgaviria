# Hi there! 👋

I’m David Gaviria, a Software & Security Engineer currently completing my Master’s in Information Security at Carnegie Mellon University. I also hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Emory University.

## 🔹 About Me

I’m passionate about exploit development, security tool automation, and software engineering. I also have a strong interest in video game development and modding. Additionally, I’m bilingual (English & Spanish).

## 🚀 Notable Projects

- **Jenkins CLI WebSocket Hijacking (PoC):**  
  A proof of concept for exploiting CVE-2024-23898, a vulnerability in Jenkins that enables remote access and persistent backdoors.

- **Anti-Vmware Pseudo-Malware:**  
  A proof-of-concept demonstrating anti-sandbox techniques that detect and evade virtual machine environments.

- **Conversation Identifier & Extractor (Autopsy Plugin):**  
  A plugin for Autopsy® that parses and organizes SMS conversations from Android device images, outputting them as chronological transcripts in forensics reports.

⚠️ Due to academic integrity policies, many of my school-related projects are private.

## 🎮 Game Development & Modding

- **World of a Southern Victory (HoI4 Mod):**  
  A mod for *Hearts of Iron IV* based on Harry Turtledove's *Southern Victory* series. It creates an alternate history where the Confederacy wins the Civil War, leading to a redefined 20th century. The mod includes content for nearly a dozen countries, with custom tech trees, national focuses, event chains, and more.

- **Steel Division: Great War (Steel Division II Mod):**  
  A mod for Steel Division that restricts Steel Division decks to only units with Great War equipment (eliminating tanks and non-biplane aircraft), so players can simulate World War I battles in the game.
  
⚠️ **Disclaimer:** The author condemns the "Lost Cause" myth and revisionist Civil War narratives. The HoI4 mod was created purely out of a love for military history and game development.
